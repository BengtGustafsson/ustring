ustring proposal repository
===========================

This repository contains code and documentation for an upcoming proposal regarding ustring, an immutable, unicode code point string class for C++.

The ustring.h file contains a complex implementation of the ustring specification described in ustring.md. The intention is that
other implementations can be made, with other trade-offs between complexity and simplicity and between storage usage and performance.

Some additional files are ustring_ni.md which contains some background text (quite old and not updated for recent changes), and
unicode_iterator which could be another proposal or maybe used as a component in the ustring implementation at a later stage. It is
more of a synopsis level at this point,

Note that the ustring.pdf file was generated from the ustring.md file. Later this could maybe be automated in github so that the pdf file is
generated by github CI. I have no idea how to do that. For the moment I just export to pdf from the markdown editor Typora that I use.

Typora works well, but has the problem that it does not write single line breaks in its md file so reviewing changes in github is
close to impossible. I have filed a request to improve this handling but it has not been implemented yet.
